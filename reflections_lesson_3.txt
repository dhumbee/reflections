When would you want to create a remote respository rather than keeping all your work local?

	A remote is a reference to another repository. (remote automatically setup when cloning)  If multiple people are working on a project on different computers or when sharing on GitHub and making file changes on there.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?

	So you can choose which changes to keep.  You might be experimenting or maybe someone added something to try and you don't want to keep it.
