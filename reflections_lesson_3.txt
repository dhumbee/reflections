When would you want to create a remote respository rather than keeping all your work local?

	A remote is a reference to another repository. (remote automatically setup when cloning)  If multiple people are working on a project on different computers or when sharing on GitHub and making file changes on there.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up to date with your remote repository?

	So you can choose which changes to keep.  You might be experimenting or maybe someone added something to try and you don't want to keep it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	A fork is a copy of someone else's repository on GitHub, that is stored on your GitHub, not your local directory.  Clones are a copy of someone else's repository on your own local computer.  Branches are branch offs of your code when you want to try something else, they are on your local computer, unless pushed to GitHub, or they can be merged with your master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	It's benefical to use as a backup in case of a mistake.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	You could always copy/zip/email your files back and forth...but I don't think it would be as effcient as using Git.
